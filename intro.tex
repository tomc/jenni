\chapter{Introduction}

Attempting to write an up-to-date ``TaJ'' system without the Tom/Ari ++ extensions.  This document likely will be used by Jenni and Greg.

The latest version of this file should be available at \url{https://github.com/tomc/jenni/blob/master/tom-jenni.pdf}

\section{Notable Changes from Old Version}

Most notable changes are:

\begin{itemize}
	\item TaJ Relay has been updated to have the first step be all 5-4 hands.  This alleviates the need for some of the awkward \cl1 resposnes and allows us to revert to playing the semi-positives we prefer.
	\item 2 level responses to \di1 are all changed.  \cl2/\ddd are now both natural and forcing with \he2/\sss being reverse Flannery responses. \cl3/\ddd are both mixed.
\end{itemize}
