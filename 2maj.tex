\chapter{2 Major}
	
Weak 2s, fairly undisciplined. Non-vul 5 card suits are common, vul they are unexpected. (7 card suit possible.) The range is 3--9 HCP. Note that many 9s with 6 card suits are opened on the 1 level.

New suits are natural and forcing. 2NT is a modified Ogust system I've named ``5/7 Ogust''.

	\begin{bidtable}{\orauction{2M,2NT}}
		\cl3 & An odd number of trumps, 5 NV or 7 Vul. \di3 asks strength as per below. \\
		\di3 & 6, bad opener \\
		\he3 & 6, medium opener \\
		\sp3 & 6, good opener \\
		3NT & 6, 4 in other major. Good enough to commit to game. \\
	\end{bidtable}
		
Preempt RKC:

	\begin{bidtable}{\orauction{2M,4c}}
		\di4 & 0 KC \\
		\he4 & 1 KC, no trump Q \\
		\sp4 & 1 KC, trump Q \\
		4NT & 2 KC, no trump Q \\
		\cl5 & 2 with Q in theory, unlikely response \\
	\end{bidtable}
